For those times when you just gotta ask: have they tried turning it off and on again? Returns random GIFs (mostly).

## Usage

Visit `https://offandonagain.org/`. Doesn't matter what you put after the `/`. Unless you happen to hit a well-known file, you'll get a random GIF asking if you've tried turning it off and on again.

## Contributing images

I would _love_ to find more images for this project! See [CONTRIBUTING.md][] if you know of any.
