# Contributing images

Want to contribute images? _Awesome!_

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

* GIFs are preferred but not required
* Every once in a while I'll accept one that doesn't say "did you try turning it off and on again?" but not that often
* The IT Crowd is _not_ required - it's just that most instances of this phrase come from there
* The phrase "Hello, IT" is also not at all required

Send images via GitHub Pull Requests, please!
